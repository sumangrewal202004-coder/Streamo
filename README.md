# Social Media Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
I built a social media dashboard with React that includes:

- User profile section
- Post feed with like functionality
- Notifications section
- Messages section
- Responsive design for all devices

## What I Learned
1. **React Components:** How to break UI into reusable pieces
2. **State Management:** Using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks
3. **React Router:** Creating multi-page navigation in a single-page app
  
## Key Features
- ✅ Real-time updates for likes
